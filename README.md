# BG-management

Tools for monitoring, tracking and managing BG Intention: 
Develop a process/method and tools to track the various variables related to BG This will be an iterative process that requires: vastly improved problem definition Research- both the problem and current solutions and where they fail/breakdown - look at Training Peaks, Bernstein, etc... Endocrinology- what do I need to lern and how? data models data storage API programming to connect to sensors and other tools Where will compute happen? Where will storage happen? choosing framework, language, etc
